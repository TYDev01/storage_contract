# Solidity Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat and Foundry use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract.
Try running some of the following tasks:

** For Hardhat Deployment **
```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/Storage.ts
```
