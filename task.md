Deploy and verify your Storage.sol contract using both Hardhat and Foundry on Sepolia (Ethereum) and CoreDAO.
 You may choose either of the two available testnets on CoreDAO. Organize your project into a single root folder with two subfolders: one for Hardhat and one for Foundry.
 After successful deployment, push the project to your GitHub repo and include your deployed contract addresses in the README.md file.
